<h1>Condo Rentals</h1>

Condo Rentals is a real estate listing marketplace for short let and long term homestay experiences inspired by Airbnb.

Condo Rentals projects a community built on a sharing economy. It is an online platform that allows property owners to list their place as holiday accommodation and allows travellers to find a place to stay while they are away from home.

On the website, homeowners can create a listing for their property and that listing will include a written description, photos and a list of amenities, as well as information about the local area.

Travellers can use filters to search for holiday accommodation that’s right for them – such as the number of bedrooms, location and price.

Condo Rentals is based on trust. It establishes this trust by asking both guests and hosts to review each other. This creates a rating system for all listings and ensures that, in most cases, everyone has a good experience.

Condo Rentals is a modern responsive simple property listing platform suitable for use by real estate agencies and independent realtors. With this project, you can easily create a property listing website. Some of the features built into this project include:
